## Taiwan Air Sensing: Data Structure and Quality

### Introduction
The dataset consists of air sensor data collected from devices that are installed mostly in Taiwan by the Airbox Project - a collaboration between Taiwanese academic institutions, computer industry and Taipei city government with the goal to collect measurements of fine particles in the air.

Data is being collected from two types of devices (two “channels” of data): Micro Air Pollution Sensor (MAPS channel) and EdiGreen Airbox (Airbox_copy channel).

### MAPS channel information
Micro Air Pollution Sensing System (MAPS) device is designed for academia and research purposes (Chen, 2017). Its sensors and components can be easily extended and exchanged.

Data collection started on 04/28/2017

The number of devices transmitting varies between 40 and 6. It goes down over time due to multiple failures. This channel is prone to temperature malfunctions and GPS failures.

### AirBox channel information

AirBox devices has been developed in partnership with EdiGreen company. They are robust and simple. These devices have been donated by the Taipei city government to be used by community (schools, public buildings, etc.) 

Data collection started on 9/11/2017

The number of devices transmitting varies  between 700 and 1000 per day.
